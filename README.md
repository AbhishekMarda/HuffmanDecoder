<h1> Huffman decoding! </h1>

You can either clone this repository if you are using Xcode, or you can create a C++ project from the C++ files. 

Your compressed file, say `compressedfilename.dat` must be in the format of `output.dat` file from [my Huffman Encoder project](https://github.com/AbhishekMarda/HuffmanEncoder).

To run from terminal, do the following steps:

1. Go to the target folder of your project with the executable file.

2. Put compressedfilename.dat in that folder.

3. Using terminal in the folder that contains the target file, run `./huffmanencoder compressedfilename.dat yourfavoriteoutputfilename`

4. The code will create an `yourfavoriteoutputfilename.txt` file which will be the uncompressed version for the file.

I hope you enjoy reading my code and playing around with the decocoder :)
